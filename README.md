# netlify-vars

Just a simple utility for pulling environment variables from your Netlify site to your local machine.

```
$ npm install ample/netlify-vars -g
```

You'll need to create an API access token and call the script like, so...

```
NETLIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=... netlify-vars <your-site-name>
```
